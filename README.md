This game is based on the Tilevania section of the GameDev.tv Unity 2d course. With around 5 months of Unity experience, this was by far my most ambitious project at the time.

Except for the core input control reading and tile building, mostly everything except the art assets is originally implemented by me:
- A more diverse moveset with over 10 different actions apart from running, including: wall jumping, walking, crouching, ground sliding, throw, attack, parry, hiding behind bushes/stones and more.
- The player is able to choose between 2 characters with different statistics that allow for different gameplay styles.
- Menu system with all kinds of affordances to allow an easier understanding of the UI to the player. 
- All particle effects are made from scratch (except the sprites).
- 4 levels featuring cave and bamboo forests themes with different flows.
- 4 enemy types with unique behaviour: 2 standard types and 2 elite types featured in the last level.
- A strong stealth-based gameplay. Hiding and hitting enemies from behind is the main way to progress.
- A health system to complement the lives system.
- Collectables that heal the player and increase the shuriken in the inventory.
- The ability to set different volume levels for the background music and the SFXs
